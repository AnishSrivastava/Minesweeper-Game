# Minesweeper-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Minesweeper game in Python. The game is played on a rectangular grid of cells, where some cells contain hidden mines. The player's goal is to uncover all of the cells on the grid without revealing any of the mines, which are scattered randomly throughout the grid.
